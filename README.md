### Awards Page

- Use https://www.omdbapi.com to search for movies.
- From the search page a user can select multiple movies for each category and make an initial selection list.
- Display the list of categories and nominees on the awards page. Please follow the design in the wireframe below.
- When you click on a nominee, we should highlight the nominee card and save the selections in state. A user can only select one nominee per category, and we should be able to see all of their selections highlighted.
- Make the layout responsive with at least one breakpoint (your choice as to how it looks on a smaller screen width).
- Once the user is finished making their selections, they can click on a submit button that displays a results modal screen. A user can dismiss the modal by clicking on the close button (follow the wireframe below).
